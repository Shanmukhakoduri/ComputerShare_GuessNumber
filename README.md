# ComputerShare_GuessNumber
This program is written to submit for the computer share interview. This program is about the guessing the number.


<b>Rules:</b>

You will be prompted to enter a number from 1 to 10.
Our logic will check whether the number entered by you is the same as we thought.


If it is the same, we will congratulate you, else you will have to re-run it.
If you don't enter an integer, it will ask you to enter again!
